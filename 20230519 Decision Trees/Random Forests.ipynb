However, they’re not without their weaknesses — decision trees are often prone to overfitting.\n\nWe’ve discussed some strategies to minimize this problem, like pruning, but sometimes that isn’t enough. We need to find another way to generalize our trees. This is where the concept of a *random forest* comes in handy.\n\nA *random forest* is an ensemble machine learning technique — a random forest contains many decision trees that all work together to classify new points. When a random forest is asked to classify a new point, the random forest gives that point to each of the decision trees. Each of those trees reports their classification and the random forest returns the most popular classification. It’s like every tree gets a vote, and the most popular classification wins.\n\nSome of the trees in the random forest may be overfit, but by making the prediction based on a large number of trees, overfitting will have less of an impact.\n\nIn this lesson, we’ll learn how the trees in a random forest get created.\n\n<img src=\"RF.png\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\">","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"475952b5-e4e3-42b3-b33c-95590af007ec"},{"source":"## Bagging\n\nYou might be wondering how the trees in the random forest get created. After all, right now, our algorithm for creating a decision tree is deterministic — given a training set, the same tree will be made every time.\n\nRandom forests create different trees using a process known as `bagging`. Every time a decision tree is made, it is created using a different subset of the points in the training set. For example, if our training set had `1000` rows in it, we could make a decision tree by picking `100` of those rows at random to build the tree. This way, every tree is different, but all trees will still be created from a portion of the training data.\n\nOne thing to note is that when we’re randomly selecting these `100` rows, we’re doing so `with replacement`. Picture putting all `100` rows in a bag and reaching in and grabbing one row at random. After writing down what row we picked, we put that row back in our bag.\n\nThis means that when we’re picking our `100` random rows, we could pick the same row more than once. In fact, it’s very unlikely, but all `100` randomly picked rows could all be the same row!\n\nBecause we’re picking these rows with replacement, there’s no need to shrink our bagged training set from `1000` rows to `100`. We can pick `1000` rows at random, and because we can get the same row more than once, we’ll still end up with a unique data set.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0c6e39c9-206f-4527-a049-4aa989cc46d6"},{"source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport random\nfrom tree import *  # our own decision tree

subsets of our initial dataset. But we can continue to add variety to the ways our trees are created by changing the features that we use.\n\nRecall that for our data set, the original features were the following:\n- age\n- gender\n- education\n- country of current residence\n- ethnicity\n- neuroticism score\n- extraversion score\n- openness to experience score\n- agreeableness score\n- conscientiousness score\n- impulsiveness score\n- sensation seeing score\n\nRight now when we create a decision tree, we look at every one of those features and choose to split the data based on the feature that produces the most information gain. We could change how the tree is created by only allowing a subset of those features to be considered at each split.\n\nFor example, when finding which feature to split the data on the first time, we might randomly choose to only consider ethnicity, impulsiveness, country of current residence and age.\n\nAfter splitting the data on the best feature from that subset, we’ll likely want to split again. For this next split, we’ll randomly select three features again to consider. This time those features might be age, ethnicity, openness to experience and education. We’ll continue this process until the tree is complete.\n\nOne question to consider is how to choose the number of features to randomly select. Why did we choose `4` in this example? A good rule of thumb is to randomly select the square root of the total number of features. Our drugs dataset doesn’t have a lot of features, so it's only just possible to follow this rule. But if we had a dataset with `25` features for example, we’d want to randomly select `5` features to consider at every split point.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"931bd97b-794e-4101-8fc4-a64487eff0ca"},{"source":"# copied from `tree.py`\ndef find_best_split(dataset, labels):\n    best_gain = 0\n    best_feature = 0\n    \n    for feature in range(len(dataset[0])):\n        data_subsets, label_subsets = split(dataset, labels, feature)\n        gain = information_gain(labels, label_subsets)\n        if gain > best_gain:\n            best_gain, best_feature = gain, feature\n    return best_gain, best_feature\n\n\n# determine the best feature to split the data on (openness to experience)\nprint(find_best_split(attributes_subset, drug_subset))","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"edb4f2d8-a3c3-456d-bade-a55e748c4754","execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"(0.06448837777958108, 9)\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"source":"# modify find_best_split to only consider a subset of the features\ndef find_best_split(dataset, labels, num_features):\n    best_gain = 0\n    best_feature = 0\n    features = np.random.choice(len(dataset[0]), num_features, replace=False)\n    \n    for feature in features:\n        data_subsets, label_subsets = split(dataset, labels, feature)\n        gain = information_gain(labels, label_subsets)\n        if gain > best_gain:\n            best_gain, best_feature = gain, feature\n    return best_gain, best_feature\n\n\n# check if the best feature to split on is the same\nprint(find_best_split(attributes_subset, drug_subset, 4))","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"668b995e-bb91-4220-95e5-e95509548b64","execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"(0.061699617406980725, 7)\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"source":"## Classify\n\nNow that we can make different decision trees, it’s time to plant a whole forest!

We created the tree by using every row from the training set once and considered every feature when splitting the data rather than a random subset.\n\nLet’s also calculate the accuracy of a random forest and see how it compares!","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cf016629-dc6e-47a6-84f8-3342d35d6c65"},{"source":"# read in the data\nwith open(\"drug_consumption.data\", \"r\") as f:\n    data = []\n    for line in f:\n        attributes = line.strip().split(\",\")[1:13]\n        attributes.append(line.strip().split(\",\")[28])\n        data.append(attributes)\n\n# shuffle it\nrandom.shuffle(attributes)\n\n# separate the data into features and labels\nattributes = [x[:-1] for x in data]\ndrug = [x[-1] for x in data]\n\n# split into training and test sets\nX_train = attributes[:int(len(attributes)*0.8)]\ny_train = drug[:int(len(attributes)*0.8)]\n\nX_test = attributes[int(len(attributes)*0.8):]\ny_test = drug[int(len(attributes)*0.8):]\n\n# create a single tree\ntree = build_tree(X_train, y_train)\ntree_correct = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(X_test)):\n    pred = classify(X_test[i], tree)\n    if pred == y_test[i]:\n        tree_correct += 1\nprint(tree_correct / len(X_test))","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"0143ba80-84c6-490e-a295-0b4348b1641e","execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"0.23872679045092837\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"source":"# create a random forest algorithm\ndef build_random_forest(n, training_data, training_labels):\n    trees = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indices = [random.randint(0, len(training_data)-1) for x in range(len(training_data))]\n\n        training_data_subset = [training_data[index] for index in indices]\n        training_labels_subset = [training_labels[index] for index in indices]\n\n        tree = build_bagged_tree(training_data_subset, training_labels_subset, 2)\n        trees.append(tree)\n    return trees\n\n# create a random forest with 40 trees\nrandom_forest = build_random_forest(40, X_train, y_train)\nforest_correct = 0\n\npreds = []\nfor i in range(len(X_test)):\n    for tree in random_forest:\n        preds.append(classify(X_test[i], tree))\n    forest_pred = max(preds, key=preds.count)\n    if forest_pred == y_test[i]:\n        forest_correct += 1\nprint(forest_correct / len(X_test))","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"a1e22b3e-cd6d-44ab-9151-091d69b3705e","execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"0.0\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"source":"## Random Forests in scikit-learn\n\nYou now have the ability to make a random forest using your own decision trees.

Review\n\nHere are some of the major takeaways about random forests:\n\n- A random forest is an ensemble machine learning model. It makes a classification by aggregating the classifications of many decision trees.\n- Random forests are used to avoid overfitting. By aggregating the classification of multiple trees, having overfitted trees in a random forest is less impactful.\n- Every decision tree in a random forest is created by using a different subset of data points from the training set. Those data points are chosen at random *with replacement*, which means a single data point can be chosen more than once. This process is known as *bagging*.\n- When creating a tree in a random forest, a randomly selected subset of features are considered as candidates for the best splitting feature. If your dataset has `n` features, it is common practice to randomly select the square root of `n` features.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"475d936e-7c72-4257-b597-e5d0a5e8327f"},{"source":"","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"f3ea2967-e64f-4c0f-82f4-66aa499f8d6d","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":""},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"","name":""}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
